### Data cleaning

This code block imports and cleans the data. It filters out unneeded NC counties and cleans up variable descriptions.

### US, NC, and county comparisions

#### Plot

The plot below shows the overall homeownership rates for the US, North Carolina, and Forsyth, Guilford, and Durham counties.

```{r}
df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(type == 'total population') %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = geo_description)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Homeownership rate',
         color = 'Comparison Unit',
         y = 'Homeownership') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(df$year), max(df$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

#### Interpretation

* Forsyth County's homeownership rate is higher than Durham County's and Guilford County's rate. The difference between Forsyth and Durham is statistically significant every year. The difference between Forsyth and Guilford is only statistically significant in 2016, 2013, and 2010.
* The homeownership rate in Forsyth County has remained steady in recent years. There is no statistically significant difference in homeownership rates between 2017 and any year until 2009.

#### Data

Below is the raw data for homeownership rates by geographies.

```{r include = to_include}
# this represents the final dataset that will be sent to others for visualizations
tableau_data <- df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(type == 'total population') %>%
  # remove moe, se, and cv
  select(-moe:-cv)

# create table
df %>%
  # only keep total housing rate
  filter(type == 'total population') %>%
  select(-type, -subtype) %>%
  ff_data_dt(c('Geographic area', 'Year', '% Homeowners', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))
```

#### Z-scores

The table below shows z-scores of all comparison communities for the past two years. To change the comparison year, replace the `c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)` segment of `year_comparison <- max(df$year)` with the desired year or vector of years such as `c(2013, 2014, 2015)`. 

```{r include = to_include}
year_comparison <- c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)

df %>%
  # only keep total homeownership rate
  filter(type == 'total population',
         # only keep data for the most recent year
         year %in% year_comparison) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('geo_description', 'year'))
```

### Forsyth County year-to-year trends

#### Z-scores

The plot above shows Forsyth County's yearly trend and the table below lists yearly z-scores.

```{r include = to_include}
df %>%
  # only keep total homeownership rate
  filter(type == 'total population',
         # only keep data for the most recent year
         geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', 'year')
```


------

### Homeownership rates by ethnicity

#### Plot

The plots below show homeownership rate by ethnicity and year.

```{r}
ethnicity <- df %>%
  # filter for race
  filter(type == 'race/ethnicity')

# line plot of ethnicity with Forsyth and all years
ethnicity %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = subtype)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Forsyth County homeownership rates by ethnicity',
         color = 'Ethnicity',
         y = 'Homeownership rate (%)') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# bar chart of ethnicity with all geographies in the most recent year
ethnicity %>%
  # only keep most recent year
  filter(year == max(.$year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(geo_description, estimate, fill=subtype)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat='identity') +
  labs(title = paste0('Homeownership rates by ethnicity', ' in ', max(ethnicity$year)),
       fill = 'Ethnicity',
       y = 'Homeownership Rate',
       x = '') +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Interpretation

* White, non-Hispanics have higher homeownership rates than other ethnicities/races.
* Hispanic/Latinos have almost identical homeownership rates to African Americans. The only year with a statistically significant difference is 2009.

#### Data

The data for ethnicities is as follows.

```{r include = to_include}
# add ethnicity information t ofinal datasets
tableau_data <- ethnicity %>%
    select(-moe:-cv) %>%
    bind_rows(tableau_data, .)

ff_data_dt(ethnicity,
           c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Type', 'Ethnicity', 
             '% Homeowners', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))
```

#### Z-scores

Below is a table of z-scores for ethnicities in the past two years. To generate z-scores for other years, replace `c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` in `ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` with the desired year.

```{r include = to_include}
# enter comparison years here
ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)-1)

ethnicity %>%
  filter(year %in% ethnicity_years) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('year', 'geo_description', 'subtype'))
```

Below is a table of z-scores for ethnicities in all years within Forsyth County.

```{r include = to_include}
ethnicity %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('year', 'subtype'))
```

### Homeownership rate by age

#### Plot

The following plots examines the employment rate by age group.

```{r}

age <- filter(df, type == 'age group')
# line plot of age with Forsyth and all years
age %>%
  filter(geo_description=='Forsyth') %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = subtype)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Forsyth County homeownership rate by age group',
         color = 'Age group',
         y = 'Homeownership rate (%)') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(df$year), max(df$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
# bar chart of age with all geographies in the most recent year
age %>%
  # only keep most recent year
  filter(year == max(.$year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(geo_description, estimate, fill=subtype)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat='identity') +
    labs(title = paste0('Homeownership rate by age', ' in ', max(age$year)),
         fill = 'Age Group',
          y = 'Homeownership rate (%)',
         x = '') +
    theme_minimal()
```

#### Interpretation

* Some age groups have high CV values due to the age group's small sample size. The 15 to 24 year old age group has CV values above 26 every year, and values above 30 most years. The 85 plus age group has CV values above 14 every year.
* Within Forsyth County, the 15 to 24 year old age group has the lowest homeownership rate every year. But, the difference between 15 to 24 year olds and 25 to 34 year olds is not statistically significant in 2016 and 2017.

#### Data

Age data is below.

```{r include = to_include}
# add age data to final dataset
tableau_data <- age %>%
    select(-moe:-cv) %>%
    bind_rows(tableau_data, .)
  
age %>%
  ff_data_dt(c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Type', 'Age Group', 
               '% Homeowners', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))
```

#### Z-scores

The table below highlights z-scores for each age group and geography in the past two years.

```{r include = to_include}
# enter comparison years here
age_years <- c(max(age$year), max(age$year)-1)

age %>%
  filter(year %in% age_years) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'moe', c('year', 'geo_description', 'subtype'))
```

Below is a table of z-scores for all years and ages within Forsyth County.

```{r include = to_include}
age %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'moe', c('year', 'subtype'))
```
