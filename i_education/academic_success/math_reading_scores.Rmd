### County comparisions

#### Plot

The plot below shows the overall Associate degree rate for the US, North Carolina, and Forsyth, Guilford, and Durham counties.

```{r}
reading <- df %>%
        filter(measure == '3rd Grade Reading Score', group =='ALL')

reading %>%
    ggplot(aes(year, rate, color = county)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = '3rd Grade Reading Proficiency',
         color = 'County',
         y = 'Reading Proficiency Rate') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(df$year), max(df$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()

```
#### Interpretation

* Not a lot to say here, only 2015-2016 saw a statistically significant year over year change (increase)
* 2017 does not begin to be statistically significant from any other year until 2012.  
* In Forsyth county the drop in 2017 is not statistically significant
* Forsyth and Guilford counties mirror each other/are not SS from each other every year except for 2017

### Associate's degree by ethnicity

#### Plot

The plot below shows Forsyth County's 3rd Grade Reading Scores ethnicity and year. 

```{r fig.width=8,fig.height=10}

ethnicity <- df %>%
        filter(measure == '3rd Grade Reading Score', (group %in% race_eth))
        
ethnicity %>%
        filter(county == 'Forsyth')%>%
        ggplot(aes(year, rate, color = group)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    # create a seperate plot for each geography
   labs(title = '3rd Grade Reading Proficiency by Ethnicity',
         color = 'Race/Ethnicity',
         y = 'Reading Proficiency Rate') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()


```

```{r}
# bar chart of ethnicity with all geographies in the most recent year
ethnicity %>% 
  filter(year == max(.$year))%>%
  ggplot(aes(county, rate, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat='identity') +
  labs(title = paste0('3rd Grade Reading Proficiency', ' in ', max(ethnicity$year)-1, '-', max(ethnicity$year) ),
       fill = 'Race/Ethnicity',
       y = 'Reading Proficiency Rate',
       x = '') +
  theme_minimal()

```

#### Interpretation

* White, non-Hispanic rates are statistically significant from African American and Hispanic/Latino rates every year. 
* The African-Americans rate is twice as high as the Hispanic rate.  The White, non-Hispanic rate is 20 percentage points higher than that of African Americans.  And it is more that three times higher than Hispanic/Latino rate. 


### Forsyth County Associate's degree rate by gender

#### Plot

The plot for Associate's degree rate by gender is below.

```{r fig.width=8,fig.height=10}
sex <- df %>%
        filter(measure == '3rd Grade Reading Score', (group %in% gender))
        
sex %>%
        filter(county == 'Forsyth')%>%
        ggplot(aes(year, rate, color = group)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    # create a seperate plot for each geography
   labs(title = '3rd Grade Reading Proficiency by Gender',
         color = 'Gender',
         y = 'Reading Proficiency Rate') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
# bar chart of gender with all geographies in the most recent year

sex %>% 
  filter(year == max(.$year))%>%
  ggplot(aes(county, rate, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat='identity') +
  labs(title = paste0('3rd Grade Reading Proficiency', ' in ', max(ethnicity$year)-1, '-', max(ethnicity$year) ),
       fill = 'Gender',
       y = 'Reading Proficiency Rate',
       x = '') +
  theme_minimal()


```
#### Interpretation
* Again, though it may look like there are major differences between the genders - no year is statistically significant except for 2014.
* As well, no year is statistically significant from it's predecessor (year over year) for either males or females except for the jump in the female rate between 2015 and 2016, which was sustained in 2017 (as 2017 and 16 were not SS from each other)


```{r}
economic <- df %>%
        filter(measure == '3rd Grade Reading Score', (group %in% EDS))
        
economic %>%
        filter(county == 'Forsyth')%>%
        ggplot(aes(year, rate, color = group)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    # create a seperate plot for each geography
   labs(title = '3rd Grade Reading Proficiency by Economic Status',
         color = 'Economic Status',
         y = 'Reading Proficiency Rate') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
economic %>% 
  filter(year == max(.$year))%>%
  ggplot(aes(county, rate, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat='identity') +
  labs(title = paste0('3rd Grade Reading Proficiency Rate by Economic Status', ' in ', max(ethnicity$year)-1, '-', max(ethnicity$year) ),
       fill = 'Economic Status',
       y = 'Reading Proficiency Rate',
       x = '') +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Data

And here is the underlying data.

```{r}
gender_data <- gender %>%
  select(geography, year, gender, estimate, moe, se, cv)

# add gender data to final dataset
tableau_data <- gender_data %>%
    # add type of column
    mutate(type = 'Gender',
           subtype = gender) %>%
    # delete gender column since this is now in the subtype column
    select(-gender) %>%
    bind_rows(tableau_data, .)

ff_data_dt(gender_data,
           c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Gender', '% Assoc', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))
```

#### Z-scores

The table below highlights z-scores for each age group in the past two years.

```{r}
# enter comparison years here
gender_years <- c(2006:2017)

gender %>%
  filter(year %in% gender_years) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('year', 'geography', 'gender'))
```

And here are Forsyth County's z-scores for all years.

```{r}
gender %>%
  filter(geography=='Forsyth County, NC') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('year', 'gender'))
```


Write out excel workbook if needed.

```{r}
# estimates are percentages displayed in tens (60.45)
# convert to numbers to decimal percentages (.6045)
tableau_data %>%
  mutate_at(vars(estimate:se), funs(./100)) %>%
  # reorder column and do not include unneeded columns
  select(year, geography, type, subtype, estimate) %>%
  # create table
  ff_data_dt(c('Year', 'Geographic area', 'Type', 'Subtype', 'Estimate'), for_tableau=TRUE)
```
