This markdown file produces individual datasets that filter the data in various ways. If you want to write out the datasets into an excel file where each sheet is a different dataset, change the line of code below to `write_to_excel <- TRUE`.

```{r inlcude = FALSE}
# change to 'TRUE' to write out datasets to excel
write_to_excel <- TRUE

# value that sets the 'include' parameter in Markdown based on whether the document is for the analyst
to_include = ifelse(for_analyst == TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
```

The employment rate is the percentage of people age 16 and over who are working. The data comes from U.S. Census Bureau, American Fact Finder table S2301. 

### Data cleaning

This code block imports and cleans the data. It filters out unneeded NC counties and cleans up variable descriptions.

```{r}
# create list of geographic areas to keep
geo_areas <- c('United States', 'North Carolina', 
                'Forsyth', 'Guilford', 'Durham')

df <- read_csv('data/employment_all_years_counties.csv') %>%
  # we only need rows representing the employment rate
  # these rows have the phrase 'Employed;' or 'Employment/Population Ratio' in the description
  # change the description so all rows have phrase 'Employment/Population Ratio'; which is the most recent phrase
  mutate(description = str_replace(.$description, 'Employed; ', 'Employment/Population Ratio; ')) %>%
  # only keep rows for the US, NC, Forsyth, Guilford, and Durham
  filter(geo_description %in% geo_areas,
         # only keep employment rate rows and total population counts
         # totals are needed to derive percentages from artificially created groups (age bins)
         str_detect(description, 'Employment[/]Population Ratio;|Total')) %>%
  # the last section of the variable name (label) column is the same for estiamtes and totals
  # this section needs to be extracted so that estimate and total data sets can be merged on it
  mutate(var_name = str_extract(label, 'VC[0-9][0-9]$'))

# make the total counts an additional column

# create new dataset with just totals
emp_total <- df %>%
  # filter for only totals
  filter(str_detect(description, 'Total'),
         # remove 'PERCENT IMPUTED' rows because these do not reflect counts
         !str_detect(description, 'PERCENT IMPUTED')) %>%
  # only keep the variables that are needed to merge this dataset with the primary dataset
  select(var_name, geo_description, estimate, moe, year) #DON'T NEED SE OR CV?

# remove totals from primary data set and merge in newly created totals data set
df <- df %>%
  filter(!str_detect(description, 'Total')) %>%
  left_join(emp_total, by = c('var_name', 'geo_description', 'year')) %>%
  rename(estimate = estimate.x, moe = moe.x,
         population = estimate.y, population_moe = moe.y)

                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_bw()
```

#### Data

Below is the raw data for employment rates by geographies.

```{r include = to_include}
total_data <- df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(description == 'Employment/Population Ratio; Estimate; Population 16 years and over') %>%
  select(geo_description, year, estimate, moe, se, cv)

    formatStyle('cv', color = styleInterval(c(12, 30), c('black', 'blue', 'red')))
```

#### Z-scores

The table below shows z-scores of all comparison communities for the past two years. To change the comparison year, replace the `c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)` segment of `year_comparison <- max(df$year)` with the desired year or vector of years such as `c(2013, 2014, 2015)`. 

```{r include = to_include}
year_comparison <- c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)

df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(description == 'Employment/Population Ratio; Estimate; Population 16 years and over',

### Employment rate by ethnicity

#### Plot

The plot below shows Forsyth County's employment rate by ethnicity and year. Many hispanic values are missing due to insufficient data.

```{r fig.width=8,fig.height=10}

  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = ethnicity)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +

         color = 'Ethnicity',
         y = 'Percent employed') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_bw()
```

#### Data

The data for ethnicities is as follows.

```{r include = to_include}
ethnicity_data <- ethnicity  %>%
  select(geo_description, year, ethnicity, estimate, moe, se, cv)

# write out data set to excel only needed

  # color cv numbers based on value
  formatStyle('cv', color = styleInterval(c(12, 30), c('black', 'blue', 'red')))
```

#### Z-scores

Below is a table of z-scores for ethnicities in the past two years. To generate z-scores for other years, replace `c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` in `ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` with the desired year.

```{r include = to_include}
# enter comparison years here
ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)-1)

ethnicity %>%

### Forsyth County employment rate by gender
