This markdown file produces individual datasets that filter the data in various ways. If you want to write out the datasets into an excel workbook where each sheet is a different dataset, change the line of code below to `write_to_excel <- TRUE`. To change the filename of the saved workbook, edit `excel_file <- 'employment_disparities.xlsx'`.

```{r}
# change to 'TRUE' to write out datasets to excel
write_to_excel <- FALSE


if (write_to_excel == TRUE) {
  # install package to write to excel only if it is needed
  library(openxlsx)
  
  # name of the excel file to save to (can be changed)
  excel_file <- 'employment_disparities.xlsx'
  
  # create workbook to save sheets to
  wb <- createWorkbook()
}
```

The employment rate is the percentage of people age 16 and over who are working. The data comes from U.S. Census Bureau, American Fact Finder table S2301. 

### Data cleaning

This code block imports and cleans the data. It filters out unneeded NC counties and cleans up variable descriptions.

```{r}
# create list of geographic areas to keep
geo_areas <- c('United States', 'North Carolina', 
                'Forsyth', 'Guilford', 'Durham')

df <- read_csv('data/employment_all_years_counties.csv') %>%
  # we only need rows representing the employment rate
  # these rows have the phrase 'Employed;' or 'Employment/Population Ratio' in the description
  # change the description so all rows have phrase 'Employment/Population Ratio'; which is the most recent phrase
  mutate(description = str_replace(.$description, 'Employed; ', 'Employment/Population Ratio; ')) %>%
  # only keep rows for the US, NC, Forsyth, Guilford, and Durham
  filter(geo_description %in% geo_areas,
         # only keep employment rate rows and total population counts
         # totals are needed to derive percentages from artificially created groups (age bins)
         str_detect(description, 'Employment[/]Population Ratio;|Total')) %>%
  # the last section of the variable name (label) column is the same for estiamtes and totals
  # this section needs to be extracted so that estimate and total data sets can be merged on it
  mutate(var_name = str_extract(label, 'VC[0-9][0-9]$'))

# make the total counts an additional column

# create new dataset with just totals
emp_total <- df %>%
  # filter for only totals
  filter(str_detect(description, 'Total'),
         # remove 'PERCENT IMPUTED' rows because these do not reflect counts
         !str_detect(description, 'PERCENT IMPUTED')) %>%
  # only keep the variables that are needed to merge this dataset with the primary dataset
  select(var_name, geo_description, estimate, moe, year) #DON'T NEED SE OR CV?

# remove totals from primary data set and merge in newly created totals data set
df <- df %>%
  filter(!str_detect(description, 'Total')) %>%
  left_join(emp_total, by = c('var_name', 'geo_description', 'year')) %>%
  rename(estimate = estimate.x, moe = moe.x,
         population = estimate.y, population_moe = moe.y)

# create vector of years of data, to be used later
years <- seq(2006, 2017, 1)
```

### Forsyth County employment rate disparities by race and ethnicity

#### Plot

The plot below shows Forsyth County's employment rate disparities by ethnicity and year. The disparities reflect ratios between white income and african american or hispanic income. Many hispanic values are missing due to insufficient data.

```{r}

ethnicity <- df %>%
  # filter for rows containing ethnicity data
  ff_acs_ethnicity(description)

# create different datasets for each race
# this is needed to calculate ratios by race
ethnicity_aa <- filter(ethnicity, ethnicity == 'African American')
ethnicity_hl <- filter(ethnicity, ethnicity == 'Hispanic/Latino')
ethnicity_wh <- filter(ethnicity, ethnicity == 'White, non-Hispanic')

# each dataset must have the same number of rows, if they do not there is a problem
# check to see if all the datasets do not have the same number of rows
if (!(nrow(ethnicity_aa) == nrow(ethnicity_hl) &
    nrow(ethnicity_aa) == nrow(ethnicity_wh) &
    nrow(ethnicity_hl) == nrow(ethnicity_wh))) {
  
  print('!!!!! There is a problem. All the racial comparison data sets do not have the same number of rows!!!!')
      
}

# calculate ratio and moe of each racial comparison
aa_wh <- ff_acs_ratios(ethnicity_wh$estimate, ethnicity_wh$moe, 
                       ethnicity_aa$estimate, ethnicity_aa$moe) %>%
  #add years, repeat each year once for each geographic area
  mutate(year = rep(years, each=length(geo_areas)),
         # add geographic areas; add each geographic area once for each year
         geo_description = rep(geo_areas, times=length(years)),
         # add description of comparison
         description = 'White to african american ratio')

hl_wh <- ff_acs_ratios(ethnicity_wh$estimate, ethnicity_wh$moe, 
                       ethnicity_hl$estimate, ethnicity_hl$moe) %>%
  #add years, repeat each year once for each geographic area
  mutate(year = rep(years, each=length(geo_areas)),
         # add geographic areas; add each geographic area once for each year
         geo_description = rep(geo_areas, times=length(years)),
         # add description of comparison
         description = 'White to hispanic/latinx ratio')

# combine both datasets into one
ethnic_ratios <- bind_rows(aa_wh, hl_wh) %>%
  # reorder columns
  select(year, description, everything())

ethnic_ratios %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, ratio, color = geo_description)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    # create seperate plots for each ethnicity comparison
    facet_wrap(vars(description), nrow=2) +
    # create bold vertical line at 1
    geom_hline(yintercept = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Forsyth county employment rate ratios by ethnicity',
         color = 'Comparison communities',
         y = 'Ratio') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ethnic_ratios$year), max(ethnic_ratios$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

#### Data

The data for ethnicities is as follows.

```{r}
ethnic_ratios %>%
  select(geo_description, year, description, ratio, moe, se, cv) %T>%
  # write out data set to excel only needed
  {if (write_to_excel == TRUE) {
    addWorksheet(wb, "ethnicities") # create workbook
    writeData(wb, "ethnicities", ., rowNames = FALSE) # write data to workbook
  } else .} %>%
  # add color to CVs
  ff_cv_color() %>%
  kable(caption = 'Employment rate disparities by ethnicity', escape=FALSE,
        col.names = c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Comparison ethnicities', 'Ratio', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))  %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)
```

#### Z-scores

Below are tables of z-scores for employment disparities by ethnicity comparisons and geographic area in the past two years. To generate z-scores for other years, replace `c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` in `ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` with the desired years. For all years, enter `ethnicity_years <- years`.

**White to african american employment disparities**
```{r}
# enter comparison years here
ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnic_ratios$year), max(ethnic_ratios$year)-1)

ethnic_ratios %>%
  filter(year %in% ethnicity_years,
         description == 'White to african american ratio') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore('ratio', 'se', c('year', 'geo_description'))  %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_kable('White to african american employment disparity z-scores by year and geographic area')
```

**White to hispanic/latinx employment disparities**

*Note: NA values reflect insufficient data*

```{r}
# enter comparison years here
ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnic_ratios$year), max(ethnic_ratios$year)-1)

ethnic_ratios %>%
  filter(year %in% ethnicity_years,
         description == 'White to hispanic/latinx ratio') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore('ratio', 'se', c('year', 'geo_description'))  %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_kable('White to hispanic/latinx disparities employment disparity z-scores by year and geographic area')
```

And here are the z-scores for all years with Forsyth County.

**Forsyth County white to african american employment disparities**
```{r}
ethnic_ratios %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth',
         description == 'White to african american ratio') %>% 
  ff_acs_zscore('ratio', 'se', c('year', 'geo_description'))  %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_kable('White to african american employment disparity z-scores for Forsyth County')
```

**Forsyth County white to hispanic/latinx employment disparities**

*Note: NA values reflect insufficient data*

```{r}
ethnic_ratios %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth',
         description == 'White to hispanic/latinx ratio') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore('ratio', 'se', c('year', 'geo_description'))  %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_kable('White to hispanic/latinx employment disparity z-scores for Forsyth County')
```

### Employment rate disparities by gender

Gender disparities reflect the ratio of the male employment rate to the female employment rate.

#### Plot

The plot for employment rate disparities by gender is below.

```{r}
# gender rows have the following descriptions
gender_descriptions <- c("Employment/Population Ratio; Estimate; Population 20 to 64 years - SEX - Male",
                         "Employment/Population Ratio; Estimate; Population 20 to 64 years - SEX - Female",
                         "Employment/Population Ratio; Estimate; SEX - Male",
                         "Employment/Population Ratio; Estimate; SEX - Female")

gender <- df %>%
  # only keep gender
  filter(description %in% gender_descriptions) %>%
  # create new variable that is only the gender
  # extract either the word Male or Female from the description
  mutate(gender = str_extract(description, 'Male|Female'))


# create different datasets for each gender
# this is needed to calculate ratios by gender
gender_male <- filter(gender, gender == 'Male')
gender_female <- filter(gender, gender == 'Female')

# each dataset must have the same number of rows, if they do not there is a problem
# check to see if all the datasets do not have the same number of rows
if (!(nrow(gender_male) == nrow(gender_female))) {
  
  print('!!!!! There is a problem. All the gender comparison data sets do not have the same number of rows!!!!')
      
}

# calculate ratio and moe of each racial comparison
gender_ratios <- ff_acs_ratios(gender_male$estimate, gender_male$moe, 
                              gender_female$estimate, gender_female$moe) %>%
  #add years, repeat each year once for each geographic area
  mutate(year = rep(years, each=length(geo_areas)),
         # add geographic areas; add each geographic area once for each year
         geo_description = rep(geo_areas, times=length(years)),
         # add description of comparison
         description = 'Male to female ratio')

gender_ratios %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, ratio, color = geo_description)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    # create bold vertical line at 1
    geom_hline(yintercept = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Employment rate ratios by gender',
         color = 'Comparison communities',
         y = 'Ratio') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(gender_ratios$year), max(gender_ratios$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

#### Data

The data for gender disparities is as follows.

```{r}
gender_ratios %>%
  select(geo_description, year, description, ratio, moe, se, cv) %T>%
  # write out data set to excel only needed
  {if (write_to_excel == TRUE) {
    addWorksheet(wb, "gender") # create workbook
    writeData(wb, "gender", ., rowNames = FALSE) # write data to workbook
  } else .} %>%
  # add color to CVs
  ff_cv_color() %>%
  kable(caption = 'Employment rate disparities by gender', escape=FALSE,
        col.names = c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Comparison ethnicities', 'Ratio', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))  %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)
```

#### Z-scores

Below are tables of z-scores for employment disparities by gender and geographic area in the past two years. To generate z-scores for other years, replace `c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` in `ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` with the desired years. For all years, enter `ethnicity_years <- years`.

```{r}
# enter comparison years here
gender_years <- c(max(gender_ratios$year), max(gender_ratios$year)-1)

gender_ratios %>%
  filter(year %in% gender_years) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore('ratio', 'se', c('year', 'geo_description'))  %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_kable('Gender employment disparity z-scores by year and geographic area')
```

And here are gender disparity z-scores for Forsyth County in all years.

```{r}
gender_ratios %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore('ratio', 'se', c('year', 'geo_description'))  %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_kable('Forsyth County gender employment disparity z-scores by year')
```

Write out excel workbook if needed.

```{r}
if (write_to_excel == TRUE) {
  saveWorkbook(wb, excel_file, overwrite=T)
}
