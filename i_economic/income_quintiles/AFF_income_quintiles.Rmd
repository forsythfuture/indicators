Income quintile data comes from the following AFF table:

* B19080

**All income quintiles and corresponding standard errors and margins of error were adjusted to 2017 dollars.**

### Data cleaning

This code block imports and cleans the data. 

```{r}
df <- read_csv('data/income_quintiles_all_years_counties.csv') %>%
  ff_inflation_adjust(estimate, se, 2017, error = TRUE) %>%
  # delete columns with non-adjusted data, and replace them with columns of adjusted data
  select(-estimate, -cv, -moe, -se, -'0') %>%
  # rename adjusted columns to match naming in original columns
  rename(estimate = estimate_adj,
         moe = moe_adj,
         se = se_adj,
         cv = cv_adj) %>% 
  mutate(description = ifelse((str_detect(description,'Lowest')),'Q1', 
                                ifelse((str_detect(description,'Second')),'Q2',
                                       ifelse((str_detect(description,'Third')),'Q3',
                                              ifelse((str_detect(description,'Fourth')), 'Q4', 'Q5'))))) 

  
#write_csv(df, 'C:/Users/mjoan/OneDrive/Documents/indicators/i_economic/income_quintiles/AFF_income_quintiles_shiny/AFF_income_quintiles.csv')

### Forsyth County year-to-year trends

#### Plot

The plot below shows the yearly income quintiles trends for Forsyth County. 

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(description = ifelse((str_detect(description,'Q1')),'20th Percentile', 
                                ifelse((str_detect(description,'Q2')),'40th Percentile',
                                       ifelse((str_detect(description,'Q3')),'60th Percentile',
                                              ifelse((str_detect(description,'Q4')), '80th Percentile', '95th Percentile'))))) %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth County, NC') %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = description)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Forsyth County Income Quintiles',
         color = 'Quintiles',
         y = 'Income') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(df$year), max(df$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```


#### Interpretation

* 2017 household income quintiles in Forsyth County have decreased or are statistically the same as they were in 2006. Incomes in the two lowest quintiles, the 20th and 40th, have decreased since 2006, while incomes in the other three quintiles have remained statistically unchanged.
* There are no significant increases or decreases in quintile incomes as compared to 2016.


#### Z-scores

The table below lists yearly and income quintile z-scores for Forsyth County.

```{r include = to_include}
df %>%
  # only keep data for the most recent year
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth County, NC') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('year','description'))
         
```

### Community Comparisons by Income Quintile


```{r}
# bar chart of quintiles with all geographies in the most recent year
df %>%
  # only keep most recent year
  filter(year == max(.$year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(description, estimate, fill=geo_description)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat='identity') +
  labs(title = paste0('Forsyth County and Comparison Communities Income Quintiles', ' in ', max(df$year)),
       fill = 'Geographic Area',
       y = 'Quintile Income',
       x = '') +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45,hjust=1))
```

#### Interpretation

* Forsyth County's lowest two quintile income limits, the 20th and 40th percentiles, were significantly less than the comparison communities, with the exception of Guilford County.  
* None of the quintile income limits for Forsyth and Guilford Counties are significantly different.
* For the highest income quintile limit, the 95th percentile, Forsyth County was similar to all other comparison communities with the exception of the U.S. 
* Forsyth County's quintile income limits are significantly less than those of the United States for all quintiles.
* Note: Although differences may appear to exist between comparison communities, the color of the bar indicates whether the difference is significant.


### All Quintiles Data

Below is the raw data for income quintiles by geographies.

```{r include = to_include}
total_data <- df %>%
 select(geo_description, year, description, estimate, moe, se, cv)

# this represents the final dataset that will be sent to others for visualizations
tableau_data <- total_data %>%
  # add type of column
  mutate(type = 'Comparison Community',
         subtype = 'Total Population')

ff_data_dt(total_data,
           c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Quintile', 'Income', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))
```

#### Z-scores

The table below shows z-scores of all comparison communities 2006 to 2017.

### Tableau dataset

This is the final data set that can be imported into Tableau. Users can copy it into an excel file or download a csv file.

```{r}
# create table to Tableau data
tableau_data %>%
  select(year, geo_description, type, subtype, description, estimate) %>%
  # removes rows containing demographic data for comparison communities 
  # in all years except the latest year
  ff_remove_comparisons() %>%
  # create table
  ff_data_dt(c('Year', 'Geographic area', 'Type', 'Subtype', 'Quintile', 'Estimate'), for_tableau=TRUE)
