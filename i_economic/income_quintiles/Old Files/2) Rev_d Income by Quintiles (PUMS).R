############ begin code for replicate calculations.  You can run this section without reading it   ################################

#there are two important things to know about PUMS analysis, whether or not you go over the code below.
#One is that there are separate weights for people and households.  The functions assume that you are measuring people,
#but for household measures you must specify type='h' in the functions

#One is that SEs for measures are estimated by lookin at how the measure varies when it is artificially resampled,
#and this estimate isn't always accurate for extreme values or medians.
#You have a true weight (WGTP/PWGTP) which reflects the number of households/people, and each of those has 
#80 replicate weights (WGTP1-80 and PWGTP1-80).  You the replicate_calculation function takes 81 measurements
#based on the different weights and estimates a SE based on how much they differ.

#HOWEVER, if you are measuring a rare occurance / using a small population, 
#it is possible thatevery record has the same value and the SE will be 0.
#similarly, it is possible that a median will not change mcuh in response to reweighting.
#you should only calculate medians with PUMS data when using continuous data that doesn't have clusters 



replicate_calculation <- function(observed,reweighted_calculations){
        #calculate a SE based on the square difference between the observed value and 80 other values based on different weights
        #REMEMBER TO USE PWGTP FOR PERSON LEVEL ANALYSIS AND WGTP FOR HOUSEHOLD LEVEL ANALYSIS.
        #reweighted_calculations must be an 80 item list
        if (!length(reweighted_calculations)==80){stop("The second argument did not have an 80 item list")}
        
        #this doesn't work well when calculating medians / quantiles
        #and can return a SE of 0 if there are few enough records that they are all the same
        #(e.g. if  there is only one record that is a hispanic citizen over 65 in Forsyth, the unemployment rate of this group value would be 0 or 100 no matter how you reweight the calculation, causing the SE to be 0)

#for this analysis you will be comparing household income quintiles imported from a spreadsheet to actual household income (HINCP)

#add quintile variables to check against income.  There are lots of ways we could do this.
#I will suggest that we make one threshold variable for each quintile, and then use that to make an indicator for each quintile.

#to get the quintiles, we could have one line of code for each quintile, likealldata[alldata$county == 'Forsyth NC' & alldata$year == 2016,'Q1_thresh'] <- 20257
#we could also say quintile_check <- function(HINCP, county, year, quintile){....} and then use mapply.

#replicate_proportion()'s return function is: return(c(proportion,SE,CV,numerator_population,SE_num,denominator_population,SE_denom))
#so if x <- replicate_proportion(...), then x[1] is the proportion, x[2] is the SE, etc.


#you want to run this function once for each year/county/sample combination, then for each year/county/sample/demographic combination, 
#and put it in a dataframe
#I have uploaded an example output from python that may be helpful
#ideally this dataframe would have the following columns:
#year, county, sample, demographic1, demographic2, demographic3, 
#if you are looking at the overall rate, demographic1-3 would be blank.  
#If you are looking at African Americans, demographic1 would be African American and demographic2-3 would be blank
#If you are looking at Employed African Americans, demographic1 would be African American, demographic2 would be Employed, and demographic3 would be blank
#This is roughly how my PUMS output in python was formatted, so you can look at my old analyses for reference.


#there are again many ways to do this, and you should feel proud of yourself if you can get this to work with mapply or dplyr or something like that
#here however I will outline how to create the dataframe by hand line by line.  This may involve more lines of code and be harder to read, 
#but it should require less experimentation

#I will iterate over all the calculations that are desired, and add rows one by one


#the overall rates should be meaningless (20% each), but this can be used for verification.  It should not be exactly 20% because it isn't the full ACS dataset,
#but for instance if there are far more households in the bottom quintile than expected then this could be a sign that 
#the wrong value was entered, the files didn't merge properly, vacant houses have been somehow included, etc.
