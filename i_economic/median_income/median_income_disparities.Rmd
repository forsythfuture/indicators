This markdown file produces individual datasets that filter the data in various ways. If you want to write out the datasets into an excel file where each sheet is a different dataset, change the line of code below to `write_to_excel <- TRUE`.

```{r}
# change to 'TRUE' to write out datasets to excel
write_to_excel <- FALSE


if (write_to_excel == TRUE) {
  # install package to write to excel only if it is needed
  library(openxlsx)
  
  # name of the excel file to save to (can be changed)
  excel_file <- 'median_income_disparities.xlsx'
  
  # create workbook to save sheets to
  wb <- createWorkbook()
}
```

Median income data comes American Fact Finder table S1903.

### Data cleaning

This code block imports and cleans the data. It filters out unneeded NC counties and rows, and cleans up variable descriptions.

```{r}
# create list of geographic areas to keep
geo_areas <- c('United States', 'North Carolina', 
                'Forsyth', 'Guilford', 'Durham')

df <- read_csv('data/median_income_all_years_counties.csv') %>%
  # only keep rows for the US, NC, Forsyth, Guilford, and Durham
  filter(geo_description %in% geo_areas,
         # remove 'PERCENT IMPUTED' rows
         !str_detect(description, 'PERCENT IMPUTED'),
         # remove 'PERCENT ALLOCATED' rows
         !str_detect(description, 'PERCENT ALLOCATED'),
         # we are only looking at households, so remove families and non-family household
         !str_detect(description, 'FAMILIES -'),
         !str_detect(description, 'NONFAMILY HOUSEHOLDS -'),
         # filter out total columns because we only need median incomes, not counts
         !str_detect(description, 'Total'),
         # starting in 2017, total number of people and percent is in data; remove these so we only have median incomes
         !str_detect(description, '^Number;'),
         !str_detect(description, '^Percent'))

# years will be needed alter
years <- seq(2006, 2017, 1)

### Median income disparities by race and ethnicity

Disparities by ethnicity reflect ratios between white median income and african american or hispanic median income.
 
#### Create disparities by race and ethnicity dataset

The code block below calculates disparities by ethnicity, along with the se, moe, and cv.

```{r}
# filter or ethnicity data
ethnicity <- df %>%
  # filter for race
  ff_acs_ethnicity(description) %>%
  # calculate ratios
  ff_ratios_race(ethnicity, years, geo_areas)

```

### US, NC, and county comparisions

#### Plot

The plot below shows the median income of the US, North Carolina, and Forsyth, Guilford, and Durham counties.

```{r}
# rows with total median income have the following descriptions
# we will filter on these descriptions to extract rows signifying total median income
total_median_descriptions <- c('Median income (dollars); Estimate; Households',
                               paste0('Median income (dollars); Estimate; HOUSEHOLD INCOME BY RACE AND HISPANIC ', 
                               'OR LATINO ORIGIN OF HOUSEHOLDER - Households'))

df %>%
  # only keep overall median income
  filter(description %in% total_median_descriptions) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = geo_description)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Median income',
         color = 'Comparison Unit',
         y = 'Median income') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(df$year), max(df$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

#### Data

Below is the raw data for median income by geographies.

```{r}
df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(description %in% total_median_descriptions) %>%
  select(geo_description, year, estimate, moe, se, cv) %T>%
  # write out data set to excel only needed
  {if (write_to_excel == TRUE) {
    addWorksheet(wb, "comparisons") # create workbook
    writeData(wb, "comparisons", ., rowNames = FALSE) # write data to workbook
  } else .} %>%
  # add color to CVs
  ff_cv_color() %>%
  kable(caption = 'Median income by geographic area and year', escape=F,
        col.names = c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Median income', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))  %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)
  
```

#### Z-scores

The table below shows z-scores of all comparison communities for the past two years. To change the comparison year, replace the `c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)` segment of `year_comparison <- max(df$year)` with the desired year or vector of years such as `c(2013, 2014, 2015)`.

```{r}
year_comparison <- c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)

df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(description %in% total_median_descriptions,
         # only keep data for the most recent year
         year %in% year_comparison) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore('estimate', 'se', c('geo_description', 'year')) %>%
  # create kable table for z scores
  ff_acs_zscore_kable(paste0("Comparison community z-scores", ' in ', paste0(year_comparison, collapse=' and ')))
```

### Forsyth County year-to-year trends

#### Z-scores

The plot above shows Forsyth County's yearly trend and the table below lists yearly z-scores.

```{r}

  filter(description %in% total_median_descriptions,
         # only keep data for the most recent year
         geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
