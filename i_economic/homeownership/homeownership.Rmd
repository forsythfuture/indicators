Homeownership data comes from the following U.S. Census Bureau, American Fact Finder tables:
* B25003 (total homeownership)
* B25007 (homeownership by age)
* B25003B (African American homeownership)
* B25003I (Hispanic/Latinx homeownership)
* B25003H (White, non-Hispanic homeownership)

### Data cleaning

This code block imports and cleans the data. It filters out unneeded NC counties and cleans up variable descriptions.

```{r}
# create list of geographic areas to keep
geo_areas <- c('United States', 'North Carolina', 
                'Forsyth', 'Guilford', 'Durham')

age <- filter(df, file == 'age group')
other <- filter(df, file != 'age group') %>%
  # do not need renter information from this dataset
  filter(!str_detect(description, 'Renter'))

## calculate percentage of households with homes in other

# currently, total households and number of homeowners are on different rows (long form)
# we need both on the same row, in difference columns, to calculate percentages

# create seperate dataframes for total households and homeowners, 
# then merge these dataframes to create percentiles
other_total <- other %>%
  filter(description == 'Estimate; Total:')
other_home <- other %>%

### US, NC, and county comparisions

#### Plot

The plot below shows the overall homeownership rates for the US, North Carolina, and Forsyth, Guilford, and Durham counties.

```{r}
df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(type == 'total population') %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = geo_description)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Homeownership rate',
         color = 'Comparison Unit',
         y = 'Homeownership') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(df$year), max(df$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

#### Interpretation


#### Data

Below is the raw data for homeownership rates by geographies.

```{r include = to_include}
# this represents the final dataset that will be sent to others for visualizations
tableau_data <- df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(type == 'total population') %>%
  # remove moe, se, and cv
  select(-moe:-cv)

# create table
df %>%
  # only keep total housing rate
  filter(type == 'total population') %>%
  select(-type, -subtype) %>%
  ff_data_dt(c('Geographic area', 'Year', '% Homeowners', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))
```

#### Z-scores

The table below shows z-scores of all comparison communities for the past two years. To change the comparison year, replace the `c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)` segment of `year_comparison <- max(df$year)` with the desired year or vector of years such as `c(2013, 2014, 2015)`. 

```{r include = to_include}
year_comparison <- c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)

df %>%
  # only keep total emplohousingyment rate
  filter(type == 'total population',
         # only keep data for the most recent year
         year %in% year_comparison) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('geo_description', 'year'))
```

### Forsyth County year-to-year trends

#### Z-scores

The plot above shows Forsyth County's yearly trend and the table below lists yearly z-scores.

```{r include = to_include}
df %>%
  # only keep total housing rate
  filter(type == 'total population',
         # only keep data for the most recent year
         geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', 'year')
```

### Homeownership rates by ethnicity

#### Plot

The plots below show homeownership rate by ethnicity and year.

```{r}
ethnicity <- df %>%
  # filter for race
  filter(type == 'race/ethnicity')

# line plot of ethnicity with Forsyth and all years
ethnicity %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = subtype)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Forsyth County homeownership rates by ethnicity',
         color = 'Ethnicity',
         y = 'Homeownership rate (%)') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# bar chart of ethnicity with all geographies in the most recent year
ethnicity %>%
  # only keep most recent year
  filter(year == max(.$year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(geo_description, estimate, fill=subtype)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat='identity') +
  labs(title = paste0('Homeownership rates by ethnicity', ' in ', max(ethnicity$year)),
       fill = 'Ethnicity',
       y = 'Homeownership Rate',
       x = '') +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Interpretation

#### Data

The data for ethnicities is as follows.

```{r include = to_include}
# add ethnicity information t ofinal datasets
tableau_data <- ethnicity %>%
    select(-moe:-cv) %>%
    bind_rows(tableau_data, .)

ff_data_dt(ethnicity,
           c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Type', 'Ethnicity', 
             '% Homeowners', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))
```

#### Z-scores

Below is a table of z-scores for ethnicities in the past two years. To generate z-scores for other years, replace `c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` in `ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` with the desired year.

```{r include = to_include}
# enter comparison years here
ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)-1)

ethnicity %>%
  filter(year %in% ethnicity_years) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('year', 'geo_description', 'subtype'))
```

Below is a table of z-scores for ethnicities in all years within Forsyth County.

```{r include = to_include}
ethnicity %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('year', 'subtype'))
```

### Homeownership rate by age

#### Plot

The following plots examines the employment rate by age group.

```{r}

age <- filter(df, type == 'age group')
# line plot of age with Forsyth and all years
age %>%
  filter(geo_description=='Forsyth') %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = subtype)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Forsyth County homeownership rate by age group',
         color = 'Age group',
         y = 'Homeownership rate (%)') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(df$year), max(df$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()

```

```{r}
# bar chart of age with all geographies in the most recent year
age %>%
  # only keep most recent year
  filter(year == max(.$year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(geo_description, estimate, fill=subtype)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat='identity') +
    labs(title = paste0('Homeownership rate by age', ' in ', max(age$year)),
         fill = 'Age Group',
          y = 'Homeownership rate (%)',
         x = '') +
    theme_minimal()
```

#### Interpretation

#### Data

Age data is below.

```{r include = to_include}
# add age data to final dataset
tableau_data <- age %>%
    select(-moe:-cv) %>%
    bind_rows(tableau_data, .)
  
age %>%
  ff_data_dt(c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Type', 'Age Group', 
               '% Homeowners', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))
```

#### Z-scores

The table below highlights z-scores for each age group and geography in the past two years.

```{r include = to_include}
# enter comparison years here
age_years <- c(max(age$year), max(age$year)-1)

age %>%
  filter(year %in% age_years) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'moe', c('year', 'geo_description', 'subtype'))
```

Below is a table of z-scores for all years and ages within Forsyth County.

```{r include = to_include}
age %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'moe', c('year', 'subtype'))
```

### Tableau dataset

This is the final data set that can be imported into Tableau. Users can copy it into an excel file or download a csv file.

```{r}
# estimates are percentages displayed in tens (60.45)
# convert to numbers to decimal percentages (.6045)
tableau_data %>%
  select(year, geo_description, type, subtype, estimate) %>%
  # create table
  ff_data_dt(c('Year', 'Geographic area', 'Type', 'Subtype', 'Estimate'), for_tableau=TRUE)
```
