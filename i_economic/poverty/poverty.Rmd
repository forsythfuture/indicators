The poverty rate reflects the percentage of the population with incomeThe data for poverty rates comes American Fact Finder table S1701. 

### Data cleaning

This code block imports and cleans the data. It filters out unneeded NC counties and cleans up variable descriptions.

```{r}
geo_areas <- c('United States', 'North Carolina', 
                'Forsyth', 'Guilford', 'Durham')

df <- read_csv('data/poverty_all_years_counties.csv') %>%
  # only keep selected NC counties, the state of NC, and US data
  filter(geo_description %in% geo_areas,
         # only need rows showing the percent below poverty level, don't need count data
         str_detect(description, '^Percent'))
```

### US, NC, and county comparisions

#### Plot

The plot below shows the overall employment rate of the US, North Carolina, and Forsyth, Guilford, and Durham counties.

```{r}
df %>%
  # only keep total poverty rate
  filter(str_detect(description, '^Percent *below poverty level; Estimate; Population for whom poverty status is determined$')) %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = geo_description)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Poverty rate by geographic area',
         color = 'Comparison Unit',
         y = 'Poverty rate (%)') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(df$year), max(df$year), 1)) +
    theme_minimal()
```

#### Data

Below is the raw data for poverty rates by geographies.

```{r include = to_include}
total_data <- df %>%
  # only keep total poverty rate
  filter(str_detect(description, '^Percent *below poverty level; Estimate; Population for whom poverty status is determined$')) %>%
  select(geo_description, year, estimate, moe, se, cv)

# create dataset formatted for Tableau
tableau_data <- total_data %>%
  # add type of column
  mutate(type = 'Poverty Rate',
         subtype = 'Total Population')

# create table
ff_data_dt(total_data, c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Poverty Rate', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))
```

#### Z-scores

The table below shows z-scores of all comparison communities for the past two years. To change the comparison year, replace the `c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)` segment of `year_comparison <- max(df$year)` with the desired year or vector of years such as `c(2013, 2014, 2015)`.

```{r include = to_include}
year_comparison <- c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)

df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(str_detect(description, '^Percent *below poverty level; Estimate; Population for whom poverty status is determined$'),
         # only keep data for the most recent year
         year %in% year_comparison) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('geo_description', 'year'))
```

### Forsyth County year-to-year trends

#### Z-scores

The plot above shows Forsyth County's yearly trend and the table below lists yearly z-scores.

```{r include = to_include}
df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(str_detect(description, '^Percent *below poverty level; Estimate; Population for whom poverty status is determined$'),
         # only keep Forsyth
         geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', 'year')
```

### Poverty rate by ethnicity

#### Plot

The plot below shows poverty rates by ethnicity and year.

```{r}
ethnicity <- df %>%
  # filter for race
  ff_acs_ethnicity(description)

ethnicity %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = ethnicity)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    # create a seperate plot for each geography
    #facet_grid(rows = vars(geo_description)) +
    labs(title = 'Forsyth County poverty rates by ethnicity',
         color = 'Ethnicity',
         y = 'Poverty rate (%)') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# bar chart of ethnicity with all geographies in the most recent year
ethnicity %>%
  # only keep most recent year
  filter(year == max(.$year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(ethnicity, estimate, fill=geo_description)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat='identity') +
  labs(title = paste0('Poverty rate by ethnicity', ' in ', max(ethnicity$year)),
       fill = 'Geography',
         y = 'Percent employed') +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Data

The data for ethnicities is as follows.

```{r include = to_include}
ethnicity_data <- ethnicity %>%
  select(geo_description, year, ethnicity, estimate, moe, se, cv) 

# add to dataset formatted for Tableau
tableau_data <- ethnicity_data %>%
  # add type of column
  mutate(type = 'Race and Ethnicity',
         subtype = ethnicity) %>%
  # delete ethnicity column since this is now in the subtype column
  select(-ethnicity) %>%
  bind_rows(tableau_data, .)
  
ff_data_dt(ethnicity_data,
           c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Ethnicity', 'Poverty Rate', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))
```

#### Z-scores

Below is a table of z-scores for ethnicities in the past two years. To generate z-scores for other years, replace `c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` in `ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` with the desired year.

```{r include = to_include}
# enter comparison years here
ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)-1)

ethnicity %>%
  filter(year %in% ethnicity_years) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('year','geo_description', 'ethnicity'))
```

The next table has ethnicity z-scores for all years within Forsyth County.

```{r include = to_include}
ethnicity %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'se', c('year', 'ethnicity'))
```

### Poverty by age

#### Plot

In 2015, the Census created additional age groups, such as under 5 and 5 to 17. Prior to 2015, however, the youngest age group was 18 and under. Therefore, yearly age comparisons only trace back to 2015.

```{r}
# list of the end of age rows, to filter on
age_descriptions <- c('Under 5 years',
                      '5 to 17 years',
                      '18 to 34 years',
                      '35 to 64 years',
                      '65 years and over')

# create regular expression to filter data set and only keep rows that have one of the 
# age descriptions at the end of the row description
age_re <- paste0(age_descriptions, collapse = '$|')

age <- df %>%
  # only keep variables for 2015 and later
  filter(year >= 2015,
         str_detect(description, age_re)) %>%
  # create new column that extracts the age from the description column
  mutate(age = str_extract(description, age_re))
  
age %>%
    filter(geo_description =='Forsyth') %>%
    ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = age)) +
      geom_line(size = 1) +
      # create a seperate plot for each geography
      #facet_grid(rows = vars(geo_description)) +
      labs(title = 'Forsyth County poverty rate by age group',
           color = 'Age group',
           y = 'Poverty rate (%)') +
      scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(age$year), max(age$year), 1),
                         minor_breaks = NULL) +
      # change the order of age groups in legend so they appear youngest to oldest
      scale_color_discrete(breaks=age_descriptions) +
      theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
# bar chart of age with all geographies in the most recent year
age %>%
  # only keep most recent year
  filter(year == max(.$year)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, estimate, fill=geo_description)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat='identity') +
    labs(title = paste0('Poverty rate by age', ' in ', max(age$year)),
         fill = 'Geography',
           y = 'Poverty rate') +
    theme_minimal()
```

#### Data

Age data is below.

```{r include = to_include}
age_data <- age %>%
  select(geo_description, year, age, estimate, moe, se, cv)

#  add to dataset for Tableau
tableau_data <- age_data %>%
    # add type of column
    mutate(type = 'Age Group',
           subtype = age) %>%
    # delete ethnicity column since this is now in the subtype column
    select(-age) %>%
    bind_rows(tableau_data, .)
  
ff_data_dt(age_data,
           c('Geographic area', 'Year', 'Age group', 'Poverty Rate', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))
```

#### Z-scores

The table below highlights z-scores for each age group in the past two years.

```{r include = to_include}
# enter comparison years here
age_years <- c(max(age$year), max(age$year)-1)

age %>%
  filter(year %in% age_years) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'moe', c('year', 'geo_description', 'age'))
```

Here are the age comparisons for all years within Forsyth County.

```{r include = to_include}
age %>%
  filter(geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_dt('estimate', 'moe', c('year', 'age'))
```

### Tableau dataset

This is the final dataset that can be imported into Tableau. Users can copy it into an excel file or download a csv file.

```{r}
# estimates are percentages displayed in tens (60.45)
# convert to numbers to decimal percentages (.6045)
tableau_data %>%
  mutate_at(vars(estimate:se), funs(./100)) %>%
  # reorder column and do not include unneded columns
  select(year, geo_description, type, subtype, estimate) %>%
  # create table
  ff_data_dt(c('Year', 'Geographic area', 'Type', 'Subtype', 'Percent Employed'), for_tableau=TRUE)
```
