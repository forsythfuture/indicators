Demographic data comes from [CDC Wonder Bridged-Race population estimates](https://wonder.cdc.gov/Bridged-Race-v2017.HTML).

### Total county population

```{r}
# import dataset
df <- read_csv('data/demographic_data.csv') %>%
  # do not need rows with NA values for county; this is duplicative of rows with NAs for all values but county
  filter(!is.na(county))

# pull out total population
total_pop <- df %>%
  filter(notes == 'Total') %>%
  # total population has NA values for all demographic variables
  filter_at(vars(gender:age), all_vars(is.na(.))) %>%
  # only keep non-NA columns
  select(population, year) %>%
  # add columns for tableau
  mutate(Type = 'Population',
         Subtype = 'Total Population')
```

```{r}
ggplot(total_pop, aes(year, population)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Forsyth County yearly population') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(total_pop$year), max(df$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

### Population by race/ethnicity

```{r}
# need to filter for each race / ethnicity seperately
wh <- df %>%
  # this filter will keep non-hispanic whites with different counts for male and femal
  filter(ethnicity == 'Not Hispanic or Latino',
         race == 'White',
         is.na(age)) %>%
  # group by year and calculate total population by summing male and female
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(population = sum(population)) %>%
  mutate(race = 'White, non-Hispanic')

aa <- df %>%
  # this filter will keep non-hispanic whites with different counts for male and female
  filter(ethnicity == 'Not Hispanic or Latino',
         race == 'Black or African American',
         is.na(age)) %>%
  # group by year and calculate total population by summing male and female

### Population by gender

```{r}
# male and female numbers have NA values for all demographics except gender
gender <- df %>%
  filter_at(vars(ethnicity:age), all_vars(is.na(.))) %>%
  filter(!is.na(gender)) %>%

                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

### Population by age group

```{r}

  # combine age groups as follows:
  mutate(age = str_replace_all(age, '[<] 1 year|1-4 years', 'Under 5')) %>%

### Population by race / ethnicity and gender
