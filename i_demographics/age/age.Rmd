```

The employment rate is the percentage of people age 16 and over who are working. The data comes from U.S. Census Bureau, American Fact Finder table S2301. 

### Data cleaning

This code block imports and cleans the data. It filters out unneeded NC counties and cleans up variable descriptions.

```{r}
# only using Forsyth county for demographics 

df <- read_csv('data/age_all_years.csv')
df <- df %>%
  # convert year to integer for better plotting
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  # from counties, remove 'county, North Carolina';
  # this will make it easier to filter based on counties
  mutate(geo_description = str_replace(geo_description, " County, North Carolina", "")) %>%
  # the last section of the variable name (label) column is the same for estiamtes and totals
  # this section needs to be extracted so that estimate and total data sets can be merged on it
  mutate(var_name = str_extract(description, 'Total;|Male|Female'))%>%
        .$var_name == 'Total;','Total') 



# make the total counts an additional column
pop_total <- df %>%
  # filter for only totals
  filter(str_detect(label,'VC01')) %>%
  # only keep the variables that are needed to merge this dataset with the primary dataset
  select(var_name, geo_description, estimate, moe, year) #DON'T NEED SE OR CV?

  # create 2 dataframes one with only needed age ranges and the other with total population counts
  # totals are needed to derive percentages from artificially created groups (age bins)
df <- df %>%
        filter(str_detect(description, 'Under 5 years|5 to 9|10 to 14|15 to 17|18 to 24|25 to 29|30 to 34|35 to 39|40 to 44|45 to 49|50 to 54|55 to 59|60 to 64|65 to 69|70 to 74|75 to 79|80 to 84|85')) 




# tidy up total dataframe to include only select only needed variables create new dataset with just totals

# remove totals from primary data set and merge in newly created totals data set
df <- df %>%
  left_join(pop_total, by = c('year')) %>%
  rename(estimate = estimate.x, moe = moe.x,
         total_population = estimate.y, total_population_moe = moe.y)

### US, NC, and county comparisions

#### Plot

The plot below shows the overall employment rate of the US, North Carolina, and Forsyth, Guilford, and Durham counties.

```{r}
df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(description == 'Employment/Population Ratio; Estimate; Population 16 years and over') %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, estimate, color = geo_description)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(title = 'Employment rate',
         color = 'Comparison Unit',
         y = 'Percent employed') +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(df$year), max(df$year), 1),
                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

#### Data

Below is the raw data for employment rates by geographies.

```{r}
df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(description == 'Employment/Population Ratio; Estimate; Population 16 years and over') %>%
  select(geo_description, year, estimate, moe, se, cv) %>%
  kable(caption = 'Employment rate by geographic area and year',
        col.names = c('Geographic area', 'Year', '% Employed', '95% MOE', 'St. Error', 'CV'))  %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)
  
```

#### Z-scores

The table below shows z-scores of all comparison communities for the past two years. To change the comparison year, replace the `c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)` segment of `year_comparison <- max(df$year)` with the desired year or vector of years such as `c(2013, 2014, 2015)`. 
**HOW TO DO ALL YEARS? CAN ESPECIALLY BE USEFUL WHEN COMPARING CURRENT TO PRE-RECESSION, I.E., 2006/07 VS 2017
**OUTPUT XLXS OF ALL YEARS PERHAPS, JUST TRYING TO THINK OF HOW TO MAKE IT EASY TO SEE WHERE "ss" THINGS ARE HAPPENING
**CAN YOU HIGHLIGHT SCORES OVER 1.96?

```{r}
year_comparison <- c(max(df$year), max(df$year)-1)

df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(description == 'Employment/Population Ratio; Estimate; Population 16 years and over',
         # only keep data for the most recent year
         year %in% year_comparison) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore('estimate', 'se', c('geo_description', 'year')) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore_kable(paste0("Comparison community z-scores", ' in ', paste0(year_comparison, collapse=' and ')))

### Forsyth County year-to-year trends

#### Z-scores

The plot above shows Forsyth County's yearly trend and the table below lists yearly z-scores.
**AGAIN, HIGHLIGHT THOSE #S ABOVE 1.96

```{r}
df %>%
  # only keep total employment rate
  filter(description == 'Employment/Population Ratio; Estimate; Population 16 years and over',
         # only keep data for the most recent year

### Forsyth County employment rate by ethnicity

#### Plot

The plot below shows Forsyth County's employment rate by ethnicity and year. Many hispanic values are missing due to insufficient data.

```{r}
ethnicity_column <- 'description'

keep_ethnicities <- c('White alone, not Hispanic or Latino', 'Black or African American',
                      'Hispanic or Latino origin')

ethnicity <- df %>%
  # filter for race
  filter(str_detect(description, paste(keep_ethnicities, collapse = '|')),
         geo_description == 'Forsyth') %>%
  # create new column that is only the name of the ethnicity
  mutate(ethnicity = str_extract(description, paste(keep_ethnicities, collapse = '|'))) %>%
  # shorten ethnicity names
  mutate(ethnicity = ifelse(.$ethnicity == 'Black or African American', 'African American',
                            ifelse(.$ethnicity == 'Hispanic or Latino origin', 'Hispanic',

                       minor_breaks = NULL) +
    theme_minimal()
```

#### Data

The data for ethnicities is as follows.

```{r}
ethnicity %>%
  select(geo_description, year, ethnicity, estimate, moe, se, cv) %>%

  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), full_width = F)
```

#### Z-scores

Below is a table of z-scores for Forsyth County ethnicities in the past two years. To generate z-scores for other years, replace `c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` in `ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)+1)` with the desired year.

```{r}
# enter comparison years here
ethnicity_years <- c(max(ethnicity$year), max(ethnicity$year)-1)

ethnicity %>%
  filter(year %in% ethnicity_years) %>%
  ff_acs_zscore('estimate', 'se', c('year', 'ethnicity'))  %>%
